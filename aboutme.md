### My Story

My name is Victoria Kim and I am currently a first year at Williams College. Born and raised just outside of Philadelphia, I came to Williams to participate on the Williams Women's Golf Team. Our Fall season has been really eventful, and I am really excited to start our spring season on February 14th! 

I decided to enroll in CSCI 103 in order to get a taste of what computer science is like. I have never taken a computer science class before, and have always been curious. I think this class is the perfect way to get a taste of CS without the high pressure of having to perform. The class has been super fun so far, and I am excited to learn more!
