In this assignment, we learned how to use conditionals correctly. It was helpful to learn the different syntax and the statements worked. A tip I would give
to myself is to make sure to name the file correctly. This is the first step iin allowing the code to run properly. I also find it really helpful to 
think of what you wanted the code to do before figuring out the actual programming language.
