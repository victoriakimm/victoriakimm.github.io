In this assignment, we learned how to use conditionals correctly. It was helpful to learn the different grammer rules and how the statements worked. A tip I would give to myself is to make sure to name the file correctly. This is the first step in allowing the code to run properly. I also found it really helpful to think through the purpose of the code before trying to figure out the actual programming language.
