Ring Alarm Decor:

Empty space on your bedroom wall? Need an alarm clock? Ring Alarm Decor doubles as both an alarm clock and a stylish way to decorate your room. When a certain brightness theshold is reached, a buzzer and light will go off at the same time, indicating that it is time to wake up. 

Materials:

2  pieces of White Felt (8.5”x11”)
Tan Colored Twine (2ft)
1 LilyPad LED
1 Sewable Battery Holder
1 Coin Cell Battery
Conductive Thread
Thread, Needle, Scissors

Tip #1: Before using the conductive thread, I would recommend holding all of your components down with thinner thread. This allowed connecting the negatives and positives as well as making sure everything was neatly placed a lot easier.

Tip #2: I would recommend taping the conductive thread on the wrong side of your project down. I had some troubles with my circuit, which was caused by the ends of the conductive thread touching each other.

Tip #3: Before writing the code, I would recommend commenting on each stage of what you intend your code to complete. I found that this helped me organize my thoughts and complete the code in an efficient manner.
