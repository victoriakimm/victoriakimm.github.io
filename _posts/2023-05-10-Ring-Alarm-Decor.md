Ring Alarm Decor:

Have an empty space on your bedroom wall? Need an alarm clock? Ring Alarm Decor doubles as both an alarm clock and a stylish way to decorate your room. When you turn on a switch and a certain brightness theshold is reached, a buzzer and four leds will go off simultaneously, indicating that it is time to wake up. 



Materials:

2  pieces of White Felt (8.5”x11”)

Black Colored String (3ft)

1 LilyPad LED

1 Sewable Battery Holder

1 Coin Cell Battery

Conductive Thread

Thread, Needle, Scissors

Tip #1: Before using the conductive thread, I would recommend holding all of your components down with thinner thread. This allowed connecting the negatives and positives as well as making sure everything was neatly placed a lot easier.

Tip #2: I would recommend taping the conductive thread on the wrong side of your project down. I had some troubles with my circuit, which was caused by the ends of the conductive thread touching each other.

Tip #3: Before writing the code, I recommend creating comments for each stage of what you intend your code to complete. I found that this helped me organize my thoughts and complete the code in an efficient manner.
