Description: Coded assignment that uses if statements to mimic the results of the circuit embedded on the plushy.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend making sure that all the lines are indented properly by implementing the automatic formattor. It is also helpful to go through and make sure you are using correct syntax so that errors do not appear. This includes {}, (), ==, and more!
