Description: Using Arduino, code the Lilypad to turn on different LEDS in different patterns and at times.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend thinking aobut the timing of each action happening and trying to standardize the entire code according to thet time. It also really helped to use a boolean statement to implement code.
