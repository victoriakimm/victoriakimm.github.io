Description: Given the previous assignment where we coded leds to light up, we combined all of the leds together so that it lit up simulatenously. Each light should light up at a specific time and repeat continuously.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend doing the first assignment the more difficult way. By putting in the time on the previous assignment, it was a lot easier to combine the methods and implement simultaneous sparklies.
