Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to light up a color everytime a button was pressed. Each time the button is pressed, a different colors lights up. When the button is not pressed, the light is off.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend looking at the class slides which really helped me brainstorm on what to code and how to code it. In addition, organizing the code also helped me think through what steps needed to be done.
