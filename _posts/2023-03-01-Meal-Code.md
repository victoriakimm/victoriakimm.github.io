Description: Given a number for numberChoice and a number for mealOption, the code shut output a type of meal. The meal can either come from the secret meal or the regular meal - two drastically different types of foods. For my program, I only allowed 1,2, and 3 as valid values for mealOption. If numberChoice is even then a meal from the regular meal is outputted whereas if the number is odd then a special meal is chosen. 

Tip/Trick: I would recommend mapping out the logic and optimal outcome from the code. It also helped to start with the integer values and what should be inputted into the code. I found that starting from the start and the end helped me found the code I needed for the middle.
