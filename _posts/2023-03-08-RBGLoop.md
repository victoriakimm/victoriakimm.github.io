Description: Given the number of runTimes, the code should print a color everything 10th number. One color should only be printed 3 times. About the 9th color is printed, the entire pattern should reset to print the same colors given the number of runTimes

Tip/Trick: I would recommend thinking more about the specific index that each color would be printed out in and how a different variable could relate to the index number. It also helps to map out everything on a peice of paper beforehand.
