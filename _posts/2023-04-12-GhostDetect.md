Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to light up red everytime a ghost was detected. Using the light and temperature sensor, when the surrounding are at a certain brightness and temperature ghosts appear, and the two red LEDs light.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend looking at the examples that were posted on the GLOW page. These examples made it easier to visualize what each variable was used for and how I could implement it into my own code.
