Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to light up red everytime a ghost was detected. Using the ligth and temperature sensor, when it was at a certain brightness and temperature, ghosts would appear, and the two red LEDs would light.  was pressed. Each time the button is pressed, a different colors lights up. When the button is not pressed, the light is off.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend looking at the examples that were posted on the GLOW page. These examples made it easier to visualize what each variable was used for and how I could implement it into my own code.
