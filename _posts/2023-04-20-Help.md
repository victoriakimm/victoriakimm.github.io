Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to buzz specific morse codes when a switch was one. When the switch is on, the morse code of SOS plays. Any other time, the morse code of our names play. 

Tip/Trick: I would recommend creating new function to store the specific letter or dot/dash code within so you can easily re-use and the code is easier to read.
