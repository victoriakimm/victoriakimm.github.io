Description: Using the sewing sampler and the circuit idea of the plushy, the homemade switches incorporated two homemade switches in a circuit onto the sewing sampler.

Tip/Trick: When using the conductive fabric, I would use more conductive thread in order to get a secure connection. Especially when using it as a switch, a strong connection is needed so that the light turns on fully. It make takes some fidgeting to get the switch working correctly, if not.
