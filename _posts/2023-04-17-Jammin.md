Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to play a song everytime the switch was activated to on. We found music online to then implement within our code.

Tip/Trick: I would recommend a smaller piece of the code on a separate file to try and trouble shoot and see if the switch, song, or syntax is correctly implemented.
