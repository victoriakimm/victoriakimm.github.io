Project Description: We used conductive threads to create a circuit that lights up when both the switch is on and button is pressed. Everything was sown onto the fabric to create a plushy. The plushy was then stuffed with paper to create shape.

Tip/Trick: For the future I would recommend making as many knots as possible. In the beginning I tried to minimize my usage of knots, which caused many errors. However, the use of knots is really important, and will minimize errors because it can help you pinpoint where the errors are occuring.
