Description: Using Arduino, we coded the board to light up a pwm pin a color every second. If the light is already on, the light turns off. If the light is off, the led turn on. 

Tip/Trick: I would recommend looking at the the previous class POGIL for the void setup of the code and also to get a good idea of how to start the code. I found that it was really helpful looking at examples of the same concept.
